Changelog
=========

Version 1.1.2 [2025-01-31]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed `WiFi Session list API endpoint by adding the missing "isnull"
  filter. <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/pull/632>`_
- Fixed `"migrate_timeseries" command to handle writing data when using
  UDP. <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/issues/626>`_
- Fixed `read and delete queries in the "migrate_timeseries" command,
  which were failing if the measurement name started with an integer.
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring/pull/628>`_

Version 1.1.1 [2024-11-26]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a backward compatibility issue with custom health status labels:
  previously, if customized health status labels
  (``OPENWISP_MONITORING_HEALTH_STATUS_LABELS``) were used and the new
  "deactivated" status label was missing after an upgrade, the application
  would crash during startup. In this version, a default set of valid
  labels is always available, which is then overridden by custom labels as
  needed.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

Changes
~~~~~~~

Backward incompatible changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- *Monitoring Template* is removed in favour of `openwisp monitoring
  packages
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwrt-openwisp-monitoring#openwrt-openwisp-monitoring>`_.
  Follow the migration guide in `migrating from monitoring scripts to
  monitoring packages
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#migrating-from-monitoring-scripts-to-monitoring-packages>`_
  section of openwisp-monitoring documentation.
- If you have made changes to the default *Monitoring Template*, then
  create a backup of your template before running migrations. Running
  migrations will make changes to the default *Monitoring Template*.
- The time-series database schema for storing `interface traffic
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#traffic>`_ and
  `associated WiFi clients
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#wifi-clients>`_ has
  been updated. The data for *interface traffic* and *associated WiFi
  clients* is stored in ``traffic`` and ``wifi_clients`` measurements
  respectively. The Django migrations will perform the necessary
  operations in the time-series database aysnchronously. It is recommended
  that you backup the time-series database before running the migrations.

  You can use the `migrate_timeseries
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#run-checks>`_
  management command to trigger the migration of the time-series database.

- The `interface traffic
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#traffic>`_ and
  `associated WiFi clients
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#wifi-clients>`_ metrics
  store additional tags, i.e. ``organization_id``, ``location_id`` and
  ``floorplan_id``.

Dependencies
++++++++++++

- Dropped support for Python 3.6
- Dropped support for Django 2.2
- Added support for Python 3.8 and 3.9
- Added support for Django 3.2 and 4.0
- Upgraded openwisp-controller to 1.0.x
- Upgraded inflxudb to 5.3.x
- Upgraded django-cache-memoize to 0.1.0
- Upgraded django-nested-admin to 3.4.0

Other changes
+++++++++++++

- *Configuration applied* check is triggered whenever the configuration
  status of a device changes
- Added a default ``5`` minutes tolerance to ``CPU`` and ``memory`` alert
  settings.
- Increased threshold value for ``disk`` alert settings from *80%* to
  *90%*, since some device models have limited flash and would trigger the
  alert in many cases.
- Renamed ``Check.check`` field to ``Check.check_type``
- Made metric health status independent of AlertSetting tolerance. Added
  ``tolerance_crossed`` parameter in
  ``openwisp_monitoring.monitoring.signals.threshold_crossed`` signal
- The system does not sends connection notifications if the connectivity
  of the device changes
- Improved UX of device's reachability (ping) chart. Added more colours to
  represent different scenarios
- Avoid showing charts which have empty data in the REST API response and
  in the device charts admin page

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug that caused inconsistency in the order of chart summary
  values
- Fixed bugs in restoring deleted devices using ``django-reversion``
- Fixed migrations referencing non-swappable OpenWISP modules that broke
  OpenWISP's extensibility
- Skip retry for writing metrics beyond retention policy. The celery
  worker kept on retrying writing data to InfluxDB even when the data
  points crossed the retention policy of InfluxDB. This led to
  accumulation of such tasks which overloaded the celery workers.

Version 0.1.0 [2021-01-31]

First release.
