OpenWISP Monitoring adds two timeseries charts to the admin dashboard:

- **General WiFi clients Chart**: Shows the number of connected clients to
  the WiFi interfaces of devices in the network.
- **General traffic Chart**: Shows the amount of traffic flowing in the
  network.

You can configure the interfaces included in the **General traffic chart**
using the :ref:`openwisp_monitoring_dashboard_traffic_chart` setting.
