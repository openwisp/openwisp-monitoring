OpenWISP Monitoring adds two timeseries charts to the admin dashboard:

- **General WiFi clients Chart**: Shows the number of connected clients to the WiFi
  interfaces of devices in the network.
- **General traffic Chart**: Shows the amount of traffic flowing in the network.

You can configure the interfaces included in the **General traffic chart** using
the `"OPENWISP_MONITORING_DASHBOARD_TRAFFIC_CHART"
<#openwisp_monitoring_dashboard_traffic_chart>`_ setting.
